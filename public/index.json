[{"categories":null,"content":"As promised, I’ll use this site to shitpost. Some people will say: “Why are you broadcasting your life and your thought to the whole world?” Well, the NSA, Google, Facebook and Amazon already knew every details of my life anyway, so this won’t really make a difference. Plus, I doubt anyone actually go around this corner of the internet anyway. The anime I’m currently watching is Higehiro and Yuru Yuri. I binged one night to episode 5 of Higehiro. I think it’s pretty good. I was actually waiting until it finished airing to watch (cuz I wanna binge). Idk how realistic the anime is, but the MC is a real dude for not taking advantage of the situation. Too bad there are still idiots out there who think accepting offers from lost high school girls isn’t the same thing as taking advantage of them. Hint: it is. I think next on my Spring/Summer 2021 is Nagatoro and Osamake. But besides that, I’ll just binge slice-of-life anime like Yuru Yuri, Hitoribocchi, Kobayashi (heard S2 is airing), 300 years slime, Love Lab, and so on. I found that my performance improves when I binged anime the night before. I once watched anime till 2 AM instead of studying for a programming final exam at 8 am the same day. I get a 5 hours sleep, wake up to the anime’s OP and aced the exam. Coincidence? Also anime helps reduce stress. Kinda. Not exactly scientific, but some animes are pretty light-hearted and really help when I have a particularly bad day.

Yea, his birthday is right next to Father’s day. Today is his real birthday. On most paperwork, however, he’s listed as born on a different day (because my grandparent was too busy to remember when he was born, so they just wrote some random day down). Happy birthday Dad. I didn’t do much preparation this year; however, I’ll make a real birthday and birthday gift when I get a job and stuff (or any internship that’ll pay me well…) Thanks for working and carrying the family. You were away for a large part of my life because you were working offshore and trying to get us a better life; still, I enjoy doing stuff with you. PS: I got my first taste of living away from my family a.k.a. living in NYU dorm. Now I’m currently living with my family for the summer. I still do the same kind of stuff, still go to sleep and wake up at ungodly hours, still procrastinate all assignments,… Still, it feels different having my family with me. Not that I interacted with them a lot during the day, but their presence is already comforting enough. To borrow a phrase from a language I’m learning: 嬉しいです.

    <description><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s the NBA finals, and this reminds me that it&rsquo;s time for shitpost. I haven&rsquo;t shitpost enough about anime, so time to talk about sports. I&rsquo;m not qualified to talk about professional sports like your usual ESPN analysts (not that they&rsquo;re even qualified to begin with), so I won&rsquo;t. However, I did play a couple of sports: Tennis tournament when I was young, swimming, soccer (cuz I&rsquo;m Asian), and basketball in high school (I still cross people up).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I played chess. A bit. Since 5th grade or so.
I won some tournament back in Vietnam and here in US (not scholastic lmao). Some of my games under USCF are online, however most of the game I played in Vietnam (when I was stupid and sacked all my pieces) are lost. I kept annotation of all games, but I threw away most of it when I went to the US.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I just finished tutoring an 11 years old on Algebra I today.
The tutoring system is weird, especially for Asian countries/cultures (imo). I attended a public elementary school in Vietnam. The school is pretty good, but the teachers are still underpaid. So my teacher decided to open an after-school class at her house and make all the kids take it as an implicit quid pro quo for better grades in her class.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that after long deliberation and hard work, I finally feel comfortable enough to use an anime girl for my Codeforces avatar (handle: NotSponsored)
I wanna thanks my ICPC teammate, my ICPC coach, my parents, the pet that I&rsquo;ll adopt in the future, my country, God and my future employers (assume I&rsquo;ll have any) for this opportunity. It&rsquo;s truly a great honor to finally have an anime profile pic for a competitive coding account.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[As promised, I&rsquo;ll use this site to shitpost. Some people will say: &ldquo;Why are you broadcasting your life and your thought to the whole world?&rdquo; Well, the NSA, Google, Facebook and Amazon already knew every details of my life anyway, so this won&rsquo;t really make a difference. Plus, I doubt anyone actually go around this corner of the internet anyway.
The anime I&rsquo;m currently watching is Higehiro and Yuru Yuri.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I played chess. A bit. Since 5th grade or so.
I won some tournament back in Vietnam and here in US (not scholastic lmao). Some of my games under USCF are online, however most of the game I played in Vietnam (when I was stupid and sacked all my pieces) are lost. I kept annotation of all games, but I threw away most of it when I went to the US.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I arranged my first ever guitar song!
It&rsquo;s for this song. From an anime ofc. Very good anime at that; don&rsquo;t be fooled by the title, it&rsquo;s not about that.
I&rsquo;ll upload both the Guitar Pro and PDF in due time to the Google Drive folder. Frankly, I&rsquo;m too lazy to do it rn so&hellip; But I&rsquo;ll leave it free as a contribution to the guitar community that I constantly pulled tabs from.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Any anime guitar repo would be incomplete without K-On, literally the greatest guitar anime there ever was. Therefore, the Drive folder now includes K-On.
Also, my guitar repos are all tabs available online, and they are made available by very good and generous people (who are much more talented than me) that made these tabs and distribute it for free (some example: vvxo, Aethersan , Tam Lu, okayan_zeak21, and Very Nize).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So I woke up to this today.
I highly doubt that it&rsquo;s actually anyone who read my website or download from the Guitar S3 bucket at all. After all, I&rsquo;m not that popular. I think it&rsquo;s Google, Yahoo and their web crawler trying to index that website.
With that said, I hate Google, Yahoo and their web crawler. And although the layout looks quite pretty, it&rsquo;s also a big inconvenience to anyone who want to download in bulk.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I uploaded my entire guitar folders up to this point. About ~700 ish tabs, mostly/all fingerstyles (no chords btw). Note that they&rsquo;re mostly anime (though, imo, all of the songs in there are very good OP/ED. At least the one you can play on guitar anyway). They&rsquo;re mostly public, although quite hard to find (some sites I used is gametabs.net and online Youtubers).
Access it at http://triet-guitar.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Please don&rsquo;t flood it with download request.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that after long deliberation and hard work, I finally feel comfortable enough to use an anime girl for my Codeforces avatar (handle: NotSponsored)
I wanna thanks my ICPC teammate, my ICPC coach, my parents, the pet that I&rsquo;ll adopt in the future, my country, God and my future employers (assume I&rsquo;ll have any) for this opportunity. It&rsquo;s truly a great honor to finally have an anime profile pic for a competitive coding account.]]></description>

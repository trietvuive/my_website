# Anime I'm watching

As promised, I'll use this site to shitpost. Some people will say: "Why are you 
broadcasting your life and your thought to the whole world?" Well, the NSA, Google,
Facebook and Amazon already knew every details of my life anyway, so this won't really make
a difference. Plus, I doubt anyone actually go around this corner of the internet anyway.

The anime I'm currently watching is Higehiro and Yuru Yuri.

I binged one night to episode 5 of Higehiro. I think it's pretty good. I 
was actually waiting until it finished airing to watch (cuz I wanna binge).

Idk how realistic the anime is, but the MC is a real dude for not taking advantage
of the situation.
Too bad there are still idiots out there who think accepting offers from lost high school girls 
isn't the same thing as taking advantage of them. Hint: it is.

I think next on my Spring/Summer 2021 is Nagatoro and Osamake. But besides that, I'll just binge
slice-of-life anime like Yuru Yuri, Hitoribocchi, Kobayashi (heard S2 is airing), 300 years slime, Love Lab,
and so on. I found that my performance improves when I binged anime the night before. I once watched
anime till 2 AM instead of studying for a programming final exam at 8 am the same day. I get a 5 hours sleep,
wake up to the anime's OP and aced the exam. Coincidence?

Also anime helps reduce stress. Kinda. Not exactly scientific, but some animes are pretty light-hearted
and really help when I have a particularly bad day.

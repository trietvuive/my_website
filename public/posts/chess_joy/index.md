# Chess going mainstream, and how to have fun playing chess


I played chess. A bit. Since 5th grade or so.

I won some tournament back in Vietnam and here in US (not scholastic lmao). Some of my games under USCF are online, 
however most of the game I played in Vietnam (when I was stupid and sacked all my pieces) are lost. I kept annotation of all games, but I threw away most of it when I went to the US.

I wished I haven't.

You see, chess is a funny game and has a funny reputation. It's considered a game of intellectual, but ever since Deep Blue beat Kasparov, 
it has become a contest of who remember more Stockfish lines (not to downplay the top chess players' achievement and intelligence; remembering stuff 
isn't easy, because if it is, I would have good grade by now). However, I'm not here to reminisce about the day of Paul Morphy or the drunk Alekhine; 
the chess quality has definitely increased, and the number of draws are mostly due to incredible precision from both sides.

Still, for anyone who's new to chess or just joined chess due to the Twitch boom, enjoy the beginning of your chess career. I assure you, you are having much more fun 
at chess than me, titled players or top players, even though losing certainly isn't fun.

I enjoyed reading r/anarchychess and their celebration/encouragement of intentional bad chess - Bongcloud, forced en passant (their hate of the London system is justified). 
I enjoyed watching beginner chess game on Youtube accompanied by the famous and totally unrelated theme of Yakuza 0 (although the sentiment of the song does accurately reflect the quality of the chess played there - sad). 
I also recently found myself watching U1400, U1200 chess game during tournament instead of Open or U2200. It's not because I think their mistakes are hilarious; rather, I think their games are much more interesting 
and worth watching than GM closed-position French defense game. And that they're having the time of their life exploring all the possibility of chess and having fun doing so, instead of resigning to the fact that 
if they play out of theory or some strange gambit, their opponent will almost certainly recount their Stockfish prep line and beat them up. GM are afraid to innovate and try things beside what Stockfish told them because 
they know if they deviate, their games will be criticized by commentators with engine or their opponent's Stockfish prep will activate and cancel any element of surprise.

The chess community has been stagnated before the Twitch chess boom. Now, with all the influx of beginners and novices into chess, I think I'm finally able to enjoy chess again. Thanks, noob.

PS: All the cool kids do lichess. Before lichess, it was a dark, dark time for chess community, where puzzles, engines and trainings are all behind paywall (some sites even charge you for playing online). Lichess was the light, 
and you'll make much more progress doing free puzzles and training on Lichess than watching paid lessons from Chess.com (which is also hella boring). 

PSS: I really hate to say this, but 1 minute chess is not good for anyone mentally. You might seem cool doing it (I did it in front of my friend; they thought I was some kind of genius - the truth couldn't be further away), 
but it's a very dangerous and addictive format (since 1 minute games are short, you'll say: "I'll play one more", and before you know it, it's 4 AM). Even if you don't want to improve at chess, play longer time control - 
it's less addictive and you can still have fun blundering all of your pieces.

# CF Announcement


I'm pleased to announce that after long deliberation and hard work, I finally feel comfortable enough to use **an anime girl** for my Codeforces avatar (handle: NotSponsored)


I wanna thanks my ICPC teammate, my ICPC coach, my parents, the pet that I'll adopt in the future, my country, God and my future employers
(assume I'll have any) for this opportunity. It's truly a great honor to finally have an anime profile pic for a competitive coding account. 
I feel that my CF ratings will only rocket upward after this.

The photo I picked is Michiru Hyodo from Saenai. 

![I initially think that she is just gonna be a generic chord guitarist, but after that EP 10 riff it is over. Michiru best girl, dont @ me.](/images/hyodo.jpg)

I haven't finished Saenai (on ep 12 on S1) but will probably pick it up again.

    <description><![CDATA[As promised, I&rsquo;ll use this site to shitpost. Some people will say: &ldquo;Why are you broadcasting your life and your thought to the whole world?&rdquo; Well, the NSA, Google, Facebook and Amazon already knew every details of my life anyway, so this won&rsquo;t really make a difference. Plus, I doubt anyone actually go around this corner of the internet anyway.
The anime I&rsquo;m currently watching is Higehiro and Yuru Yuri.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday to my dad! Yea, his birthday is right next to Father&rsquo;s day. Today is his real birthday. On most paperwork, however, he&rsquo;s listed as born on a different day (because my grandparent was too busy to remember when he was born, so they just wrote some random day down).
Happy birthday Dad. I didn&rsquo;t do much preparation this year; however, I&rsquo;ll make a real birthday and birthday gift when I get a job and stuff (or any internship that&rsquo;ll pay me well&hellip;) Thanks for working and carrying the family.]]></description>

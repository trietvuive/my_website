# The Obsession with Sports


It's the NBA finals, and this reminds me that it's time for shitpost. I haven't shitpost enough about anime, so time to talk about sports.
I'm not qualified to talk about professional sports like your usual ESPN analysts (not that they're even qualified to begin with), so I won't.
However, I did play a couple of sports: Tennis tournament when I was young, swimming, soccer (cuz I'm Asian), and basketball in high school (I still cross people up).

Let's start with a chart that tells the story better than I can.

![The growth of sport. US sports only: NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL. From ProPublica](https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/teamvalues-desktop-0707.png?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=542&q=80&w=800&s=82c3c3ed6ec5a24164ec196a2441ca02)

The chart should tells you what you need to know: The popularity of sports league has exploded since 2000. In context, they 5x their earning over 20 years, while SP 500 only 3x or so during the last 10 years 
(during the greatest bull run in history, and not counting 2008 or 2020). If you don't cherry pick 2008, then you'll barely end up with 2x over 20 years.

Additionally, sport podcast exploded in popularity. My basketball coach now also has a sport podcast. Some random white dudes you met on the street probably host a sport podcast with their friends. Literally everyone is talking about sport, 
and as a guy, if you don't know sports, then...are you even?

Not that I have a particular grudge against sports or view everyone who play sports as dumb meathead. However, I must admit that I have no idea why sport is this popular, 
or why it's a must to know to effectively hold a conversation across America.

Let's look into some of the reasons why sport is interesting (imo, feel free to add it):

_Motivation: Kids look up to great athlete or underdog who overcame their struggles. There are a lot of feel-good story in sports, if you dig deep enough. 
My favorite is Bryn Forbes on the Bucks(for the nerds, the Bucks an NBA team that's playing in the Finals), who was undrafted before becoming a key piece in a Finals squad. Or Messi. And ofc Jeremy Lin. Still pissed that 
Melos and the Knicks did him dirty.

_Conversation topic: Because sport is popular, you can essentially talk sports with anyone from any background. You can't really talk stocks with an engineers, or music with a gym rat,... 
This ultimately becomes a positive feedback loop where sports become a dominant conversation topic, therefore everyone has to know sports to maintain a conversation, thus making it an even bigger 
conversation topic. 

That's all I can really think of right now, but I'm sure there are more reasons.

However, what intrigues me was that sport's popularity comes more from people **talking** about sports than **playing** sports. [From CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6823a1.htm).

![Y-axis is the percentage meeting CDC guidelines for physical activity](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/figures/mm6823a1-F.gif)

Sure, it has gone up, but nowhere near the explosion of popularity of major leagues. There are 5x more people watching sports over 20 years, but barely a 10-20% rise in physical activity over 10 years.

Idk what to really think of it. Sure, sports as a physical exercise is fun, healthy, and helps you maintain an active lifestyle. By all means, go to your local gym or sports court. 
However, what good is it to **talk** about sports? Do you really need to know where athletes are living, what they're doing,... on a daily basis? (Because that's what ESPN covered when they 
run out of topic). Should professional sports and professional athletes be that big of a conversation topic at all? Sure, watch the game and admire how they play, their zone, their hustle,... or cheer for your home team, 
but these online "analysts" and the people who run sport podcasts only talked about how many points each player put up, their FG%, how they play,... Isn't that literally just gossip and tabloid? 
The heroic, inspirational, underdog story of sports are mostly taken completely off the table, and what's left in the sport podcasts are just discussion about private life of athletes and their teams.

I'll admit, I don't know much about the sport podcasting world. But it's quite bizarre to me how many people tune in to these podcasts to listen to someone talking about someone playing sports. There are so many layers removed from the enjoyment and playing of sport itself.
After all, are they playing sport? Or are they merely just gossiping, but a form of gossip that's tolerated by society somehow because sport topics are deemed cooler than talking about Kylie Jenner's breakfast?

PS: Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles are both very brave for speaking out. Sports, on an international stage such as the Olympics, is almost viewed as a mini form of politics itself. 
The increased obsession with sports and top athletes has also made the environment and the pressure 100x more toxic for the people involved in it. 
And sport podcast **definitely** does not help.

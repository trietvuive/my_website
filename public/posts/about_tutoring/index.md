# About Tutoring


I just finished tutoring an 11 years old on Algebra I today.

The tutoring system is weird, especially for Asian countries/cultures (imo).
I attended a public elementary school in Vietnam. The school is pretty good, 
but the teachers are still underpaid. So my teacher decided to open an after-school 
class at her house and make all the kids take it as an implicit quid pro quo for 
better grades in her class. There were around 20 kids in her after-school class on an average day. And she rented an apartment.

Vietnam has an entrance-exam system for magnet middle school. Students in the magnet middle school 
usually end up at the magnet high school and go to colleges abroad or in the US. As such, parents with the means 
want their kids to be in the magnet school. And because you have to take a test instead of paying to get in, testing prep center props up 
across the city. I attended one with 12 classes, with 30 students in average for each class.
To put it in perspective, that's more classes and students than my elementary school's graduating class. I flunked the entrance exam ofc, 
but that's for another day.

I have friends who go to that magnet middle school. 2 of them are in UMass Amherst. Coincidentally, their parents are also 
pretty well-off. And they take a lot of prep classes with me until I left Vietnam at 7th grade. Not to downplay their success or 
achievements, because they're both really talented, but rather it's more of an observation how kids who don't have the mean to take prep class 
rarely shows up in those magnet middle schools that supposed to represent a meritocratic system.

Tutoring used to be for kids who fall behind in curriculum. Increasingly though, it seems like tutoring has become a requirement just to keep up, 
and even as a mean to get ahead. I previously volunteer to tutor after-school for kids who live in mobile home park. Now, I'm some paid tutor 
for kids who skip 3,4 math classes because their parents want them to take Calculus BC by 10th grade. I'm a bit conflicted about my role at 
exacerbating inequality.

PS: I also took one SAT prep class that was provided by my school district. The class is actually filled with students who struggle at SAT and need 
actual help on the subject matter, not just tips and tricks on how to manage time and do reading questions in certain order. For however much Americans 
complain about inequality (which is still valid), just be glad that at least you don't live in a system where cram school is a necessity, not a choice. 
A perfectly meritocratic system is a lot more pretty on paper than it is in reality.

PSS: For those who're interested, the entrance exam for that magnet middle school is [online](https://vndoc.com/de-thi-vao-lop-6-nam-hoc-2018-2019-truong-thpt-chuyen-tran-dai-nghia-145911).
Here's the [math](https://vndoc.com/de-luyen-thi-vao-lop-6-mon-toan-nam-2018-2019-de-so-1-145988) part and here's the [english](https://vndoc.com/de-thi-vao-lop-6-nam-hoc-2018-2019-truong-thpt-chuyen-tran-dai-nghia-145911) part.
I have a funny feeling that even high schooler will struggle a bit on the math part. I have no idea how well a native speaker would do on the English part though. Also, the answer key is there too, so check your work.

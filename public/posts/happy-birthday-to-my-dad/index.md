# Happy Birthday to my dad


Happy Birthday to my dad! Yea, his birthday is right next to Father's day.
Today is his real birthday. On most paperwork, however, he's listed as born on a different day (because my grandparent was too busy to remember when he was born, so they just wrote some random day down).

Happy birthday Dad. I didn't do much preparation this year; however, I'll make a real birthday and birthday gift when I get a job and stuff (or any internship that'll pay me well...)
Thanks for working and carrying the family. You were away for a large part of my life because you were working offshore and trying to get us a better life; still, I enjoy doing stuff with you.

PS: I got my first taste of living away from my family a.k.a. living in NYU dorm. Now I'm currently living with my family for the summer. I still do the same kind of stuff, still go to sleep and wake up at ungodly hours, still procrastinate all assignments,... 
Still, it feels different having my family with me. Not that I interacted with them a lot during the day, but their presence is already comforting enough. To borrow a phrase from a language I'm learning: 嬉しいです.

# Luna, stablecoin and WAGMI


For those who aren't familiar with blockchain (which, lucky you...), there's a cryptocurrency called Luna/UST that crashes. Not just any random coin btw, it's on  the top 5/10 of cryptocurrencies. </br>

It's actually used as a stablecoin (algorithmic stablecoin, to be exact...) which is just a fancy term for an alternative to a dollar. It tries to artificially cap the price to be exactly 1 dollar, and if you think suppressing something's price is a bad idea, well you're correct. Why the need for such coin, instead of just using dollar or normal currency? Well, cryto space are highly unregulated, so traditional banks often frown at working with crypto exchange and product. This is their way of bypassing that.

How much? Well...

Within 3 days or so, Luna goes from 90 dollars to 0.0090.

As always, investing/trading carries certain risk. Understanding these risks is important - I hold leveraged instrument in my portfolio, and I'm comfortable with it because I understand (I hope lol) the risk involved. With crypto, however, these risks aren't properly disclosed. Many people pour into UST/Luna because it promises an interest rate of 20% by staking - think of it as lending. However, you can't lend if nobody is willing to take a loan from you. Luna/UST and other cryptocurrencies does a good job of hiding this basic demand/supply problem, until everything blows up within 3 days and everyone involved lose all their money.

What's worse is that many people lack an understanding of how Luna/UST works. As the price fall, the algorithm creates more and more Luna, effectively increases the supply and make each Luna more and more useless. When Luna falls, some people flock in to "buy the dip", thinking that the price will go back up. It does not, and their coin just become one of 6 trillions Luna created within a few days (the supply was ~300m before everything crashed). Think of it as if Facebook falls from 400 to 200 dollars, and you flock to buy it, only to realize that instead of 2 billion shares issued, there's suddenly 4 billion.

However, there's no way in hell an average person can have the understanding of all the risk involved in a cryptocurrency. Not to mention the risk involved with the code, there's also risk with protocol and third-party, risk with collateral (assets used to back up the coin) that aren't even properly disclosed,... Most of the people involved with altcoin are retail traders - aka everyday person, who simply cannot understand the intentionally obscure system that the whole blockchain space has set up.

Blockchain proposes a very free-market system where everyone is responsible for the financial decision they make. Coincidentally, that also means a free-for-all system, where creators can bait and scam people who don't know any better and run off with the money to the sunset. And I'm not too sure that's the kind of society I wanna live in.

# PS:
WAGMI stands for "We all gonna make it" - a very popular phrase in the crypto space. That's utter bs, however. Finance industry has long content with the fact that their whole space is a zero-sum game, and if they're winning, that's off the back of someone more naive. And people who wish to put money in that space should assume that kind of mindset as well - you're ripping someone off or getting ripped off. And that is regardless of whether you believe the space is positive-sum or zero-sum - when it comes to money and an unregulated industry, assume everyone is trying to scam you.

"Critical thinking" is a term that gets thrown around everytime someone fall for a scam. That American school should've teach critical thinking, then everyone wouldn't be scammed! I'd say that's utter bs and naive. To investigate these coins would require more time and effort than any layperson could afford. It would require a lot of technical knowledge that people go through 4+2 years of college to achieve. Critical thinking might help someone navigate and get out of a simple MLM/pyramid scheme, but it wouldn't do jack against the global economy system inherent in stock or the whole software world + an obfuscation layer surrounding blockchain.

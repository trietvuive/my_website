    <description><![CDATA[So I woke up to this today.
I highly doubt that it&rsquo;s actually anyone who read my website or download from the Guitar S3 bucket at all. After all, I&rsquo;m not that popular. I think it&rsquo;s Google, Yahoo and their web crawler trying to index that website.
With that said, I hate Google, Yahoo and their web crawler. And although the layout looks quite pretty, it&rsquo;s also a big inconvenience to anyone who want to download in bulk.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I uploaded my entire guitar folders up to this point. About ~700 ish tabs, mostly/all fingerstyles (no chords btw). Note that they&rsquo;re mostly anime (though, imo, all of the songs in there are very good OP/ED. At least the one you can play on guitar anyway). They&rsquo;re mostly public, although quite hard to find (some sites I used is gametabs.net and online Youtubers).
Access it at http://triet-guitar.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Please don&rsquo;t flood it with download request.]]></description>

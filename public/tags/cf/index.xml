    <description><![CDATA[There are a lot of big brain solutions on Codeforces. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just too small-brained or haven&rsquo;t learned these things yet.
This was the problem I found today.
As usual, I have no idea how to do this shit (within the time limit). I thought about DP, but then I saw the n &lt;= 10^9. Any dp solution will probably requires at least N^2 - you&rsquo;ll have to loop from 1 to 10^9, and then you have to find divisors of all number.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that after long deliberation and hard work, I finally feel comfortable enough to use an anime girl for my Codeforces avatar (handle: NotSponsored)
I wanna thanks my ICPC teammate, my ICPC coach, my parents, the pet that I&rsquo;ll adopt in the future, my country, God and my future employers (assume I&rsquo;ll have any) for this opportunity. It&rsquo;s truly a great honor to finally have an anime profile pic for a competitive coding account.]]></description>

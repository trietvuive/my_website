    <description><![CDATA[I arranged my first ever guitar song!
It&rsquo;s for this song. From an anime ofc. Very good anime at that; don&rsquo;t be fooled by the title, it&rsquo;s not about that.
  I&rsquo;ll upload both the Guitar Pro and PDF in due time to the Google Drive folder. Frankly, I&rsquo;m too lazy to do it rn so&hellip; But I&rsquo;ll leave it free as a contribution to the guitar community that I constantly pulled tabs from.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Any anime guitar repo would be incomplete without K-On, literally the greatest guitar anime there ever was. Therefore, the Drive folder now includes K-On.
Also, my guitar repos are all tabs available online, and they are made available by very good and generous people (who are much more talented than me) that made these tabs and distribute it for free (some example: vvxo, Aethersan , Tam Lu, okayan_zeak21, and Very Nize).]]></description>

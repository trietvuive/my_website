So I woke up to this today.

![That was fast.](/images/aws/screenshot.PNG)

I highly doubt that it's actually anyone who read my website or download from the Guitar S3 bucket at all.
After all, I'm not that popular.
I think it's Google, Yahoo and their web crawler trying to index that website.

With that said, I hate Google, Yahoo and their web crawler. And although the layout looks quite pretty, it's 
also a big inconvenience to anyone who want to download in bulk. I'll reupload everything in Google Drive 
and redirect the top section Guitar to the Google Drive link. I'll still leave the index.html 
in for anyone interested at recreating the site on their localhost. 

I can probably pay for that cost without any problem, and since it's probably crawlers, they 
won't crawl all the time, so the cost should go down. Still, I realized that Google Drive is 
probably best for these kind of things.

Btw, I still don't get how the guitar s3 bucket receive more request in one day than my website in 1 month.
I'm still confused on how crawler works, but the guitar bucket and my website has roughly the same amount of objects (different size ofc).
If anyone know, feel free to lmk.

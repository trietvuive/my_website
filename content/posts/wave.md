I created a way to wave using Ethereum wallet!

This is mostly thanks to buildspace and Farza, a great blockchain instructor that taught the Solidity course. I was just followed along =)

They have a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace) stream every few days or so. Basically lecture. Feel free to explore if you want.

I'll probably add a log and some other forms to wave soon, for people who just wanna leave a message or so. But this is a pretty cool project ig.

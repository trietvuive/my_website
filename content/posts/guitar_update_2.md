Any anime guitar repo would be incomplete without K-On, literally the greatest 
guitar anime there ever was. Therefore, the Drive folder now includes K-On.

Also, my guitar repos are all tabs available online, and they are made available 
by very good and generous people (who are much more talented than me) that made these tabs 
and distribute it for free (some example: [vvxo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdGCa3PaS1awUstKfHTuhEg),  [Aethersan](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackshadow1010)
, [Tam Lu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBVuu8gCilHCX19jYeiuDDg), [okayan_zeak21](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3hAdjYeCMOY_NX9UtvyrQ),  and [Very Nize](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzJ5Q4IRRGnWGMYug1akS_A)).
Obviously, there are many more people, but that's the main one that I downloaded from.

Also, again, this isn't the usual "please go support your creator"; rather, this is more of "please show them support before they stop doing what they're doing now". 
In the guitar world, there's no incentive for you to distribute your sheet/tab freely for everyone; in fact, most creators usually paywall all of their arrangements (There's literally a separate industry for sheet music that worths ~$1 billion). 
The creators that make tab available for free enjoy no more support than those who don't; most of the people I just named actually have less subscribers and views than 
people who keep it behind paywall, even though the former are just as talented as the latter.

Open source is a very hard and costly decision that doesn't have much upside, and we should actively support those who keep it open-source, rather than 
taking it for granted.

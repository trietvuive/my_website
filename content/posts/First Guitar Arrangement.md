I arranged my first ever guitar song!


It's for this song. From an anime ofc. Very good anime at that; don't be fooled by the title, it's not about that.

I'll upload both the Guitar Pro and PDF in due time to the Google Drive folder. Frankly, I'm too lazy to do it rn so... But I'll leave it free as a contribution to the 
guitar community that I constantly pulled tabs from.


I'll probably consider doing a guitar cover too. Heck, I might become the next big guitar youtuber. Who knows?


Also, it isn't as cool as it sounds. I just pull from some MIDI I found online and try to merge tracks together using Guitar Pro. Still.
I have been kinda afraid to go on the guitar/music theory route and create my own arrangement ever since I started guitar 7-8 years ago. This is a huge step for me personally.


If you need the tab urgently for some reason, feel free to shoot me a DM/email and I'll send it over. But I figured nobody read these, so I'll just update my guitar repo along with this arrangement 
whenever I feel like it.
